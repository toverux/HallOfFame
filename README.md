A Cities: Skylines II mod that allow players to take and upload screenshots of
their city, and share them with the community.

Screenshots are uploaded to a server, and can be viewed by other players as a
background image in the main menu, with information about the creator, the city
name, and controls to refresh the image, upvote or hide the UI to better see the
image, to name a few features.

The source code for the server is at
[toverux/HallOfFameServer](https://github.com/toverux/HallOfFameServer)

For fellow CS2 modders in search of code samples, the source code notably
features:

- A C# and UI mod;
- Use of React portals and manual DOM manipulation to patch specific parts of
  the game's UI that aren't exposed in the modding API;
- [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/index.html) transpiler patches for .NET
  IL-level modding.

### Acknowledgements

The mod is directly inspired from the homonymous mod for Factorio,
[Hall of Fame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame).
[Loading Screen Mod Revisited](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858591409)
for Cities: Skylines 1 also provided a similar feature.<br>
Both mods featured hand-picked screenshots, whereas this mod allows everyone to
share their creations.

Special thanks to:

- The Cities: Skylines Modding Discord community in general for their help.
- [@chameleon_tbn](https://linktr.ee/chameleon_tbn) for providing some icons the
  mod uses.

## Features & Roadmap

**Notable features**:

- Have pictures displayed in the main menu, with various information about the
  city, the author, etc.
- Choose between Full HD and 4K resolution for pictures shown in the main menu.
- Toggle menu UI visibility to admire the pictures (like a slideshow).
- Fine-tune how the algorithm chooses screenshots that are presented to you
  (recent screenshots, most liked, ancient and forgotten, etc.).
- Make screenshots and upload them via a dedicated interface, all in-game.
- Supersampling all screenshots you make to 4K resolution even if you play at a
  lower resolution.

## Development

### Installation

- Standard CS2 modding toolchain;
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) as a replacement for Node in the build toolchain.
- `bun i` to install UI mod dependencies.
- Recommended: enable `--developerMode --uiDeveloperMode` as game launch
  options.

Here's a game launch command to also skip launcher in Steam:

```sh
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II\Cities2.exe" %command% --developerMode --uiDeveloperMode
```

### Development workflow

The UI mod will be built automatically with the C# solution.

However, if you are actively working on the UI, you may recompile it on change
with `bun dev`.

You can enable the game's UI live reload on change with `--uiDeveloperMode`.

Debugging C# code can be done following these steps:
https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Debugging.

Debugging JS code can be done with the browser's dev tools by
opening http://localhost:9444
(sadly not working well on Firefox, Chrome is recommended).

Logs are situated in either:

- `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Player.log`
- `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Logs\UI.log`
- `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Logs\HallOfFame.log`

### Publishing a new version

- Update `Version` and `FileVersion` in `HallOfFame/HallOfFame.csproj`;
- Update `HallOfFame/ChangeLog.md` *with only what's changed since the last
  version*;
- Update `HallOfFame/LongDescription.md` if needed;
- @todo

## Code style

### TypeScript

TypeScript code is formatted and linted by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
Run `bun check` to check for linting errors, format files and autofix simple
issues.

You can also use Biome directly with `bun biome`.

The formatter and linter should run as a pre-commit hook if you have it
installed,
which should be done automatically when running `bun i` (otherwise run
`bun lefthook install`).

I'd suggest to use a Biome plugin for your editor to ease development.

If a rule seems out of place for this project, you can either
disable/reconfigure
it in the `biome.json` file or disable it with an annotation comment, but these
should be justified and concerted.

### C#

For C#, prefer using Rider, as code style and linting settings are saved in the
project.
Reformat your code before committing (CTRL+ALT+L with Rider).

At the very least, please ensure your IDE has `.editorconfig` support enabled.

### Commit messages

Commits must follow
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)

  user;

- `ui`: for UI mod changes;
- `options`: for changes in the mod options;
- `menu`: for changes in the main menu part of the mod;
- `game`: for changes in the in-game part of the mod;
- `i18n`: for changes in translations and translations system;
- `deps`: for dependencies updates;
- Propose new scopes if needed!
