A Cities: Skylines II mod that allow players to take and upload screenshots of
their city, and share them with the community.

Screenshots are uploaded to a server, and can be viewed by other players as a
background image in the main menu, with information about the creator, the city
name, and controls to refresh the image, upvote or hide the UI to better see the
image, to name a few features.

For fellow CS2 modders in search of code samples, the source code notably features:
 - A C# and UI mod;
 - Use of React portals and manual DOM manipulation to patch specific parts of
   the game's UI that aren't exposed in the modding API;
 - [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/index.html) transpiler patches for
   .NET IL-level modding.

### Acknowledgements

The mod is directly inspired from the homonymous mod for Factorio,
[Hall of Fame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HallOfFame).
[Loading Screen Mod Revisited](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858591409)
for Cities: Skylines 1 also provided a similar feature.

Special thanks to:
 - The Cities: Skylines Modding Discord community in general for their help.
 - [@chameleon_tbn](https://linktr.ee/chameleon_tbn) for providing icons.

## Features & Roadmap

 - For Beta:
   - Set username and Creator ID in settings.
   - Upload photo along with basic info (creator name, city name, population).
   - Refresh photo in menu screen.
   - Display city name, creator name, date of upload.
   - Toggle menu UI to better see the image.

 - Planned next:
   - Ability to send a short comment along with the photo.
   - Localization for all CS2-supported languages via Crowdin.
   - Permanently disable CS2 logo in menu screen to better see the images.
   - Report abuse.
   - Upvote button.
   - Show pictures that have not been already seen.
   - Discover mode: most liked, most recent, mixed...

 - Nice to have:
   - Photo in background when loading a game save.
   - See another photo from the same city.
   - Save photo to disk.
   - Follow creator (see more of their pictures).

## Development

### Installation

 - Standard CS2 modding toolchain;
 - `npm i` in `HallOfFame/UI` to install UI mod dependencies.
 - Recommended: enable `--developerMode --uiDeveloperMode` as game launch options.

Here's a game launch command to also skip launcher in Steam:

```sh
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II\Cities2.exe" %command% --developerMode --uiDeveloperMode
```

### Development workflow

The UI mod will be built automatically with the C# solution.

However, if you are actively working on the UI, you may recompile it on change
with `cd HallOfFame/UI && npm run dev`.

You can enable the game's UI live reload on change with `--uiDeveloperMode`.

Debugging C# code can be done following these steps:
https://cs2.paradoxwikis.com/Debugging.

Debugging JS code can be done with the browser's dev tools by opening http://localhost:9444
(sadly not working well on Firefox, Chrome is recommended).

Logs are situated in either:
 - `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Player.log`
 - `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Logs\UI.log`
 - `%appdata%\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Logs\HallOfFame.log`

### Publishing a new version

 - Update `Version` and `FileVersion` in `HallOfFame/HallOfFame.csproj`;
 - Update `HallOfFame/ChangeLog.md` *with only what's changed since the last version*;
 - Update `HallOfFame/LongDescription.md` if needed;
 - @todo

## Code style

### TypeScript

TypeScript code is formatted and linted by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev).
Run `npm run check` to check for linting errors, format files and autofix simple issues.

You can also use Biome directly with `npx biome`.

The formatter and linter should run as a pre-commit hook if you have it installed,
which should be done automatically when running `npm i` (otherwise run `npx lefthook install`).

I'd suggest to use a Biome plugin for your editor to ease development.

If a rule seems out of place for this project, you can either disable/reconfigure
it in the `biome.json` file or disable it with an annotation comment, but these
should be justified and concerted.

### C#

For C#, prefer using Rider, as code style and linting settings are saved in the project.
Reformat your code before committing (CTRL+ALT+L with Rider).

At the very least, please ensure your IDE has `.editorconfig` support enabled.

### Commit messages

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification and more
specifically the Angular one.

Scope can be one or more of the following:
 - `mod`: for general changes to how the mod "presents itself" to the game or user;
 - `cs`: for C# mod changes;
 - `ui`: for UI mod changes;
 - `menu`: for changes in the main menu part of the mod;
 - `game`: for changes in the in-game part of the mod;
 - `i18n`: for changes in translations and translations system;
 - `deps`: for dependencies updates;
 - Propose new scopes if needed!
