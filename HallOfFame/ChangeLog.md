**New features:**
- If you have disabled Hall of Fame integration in the main menu, you can now override it and load Hall of Fame on-demand (without changing the option's value) by pressing the "H" key while being on the main menu.
  This is mostly intended for users that have crashes with Hall of Fame on startup, now these users can load this part of the mod when the game reaches a more stable state.
- As the number of options is growing, some options are now only shown when you use the "Show Advanced" options button.
- Your public creator ID is now logged on startup. The public creator ID can be used with Hall of Fame's API for you to build custom integrations.
