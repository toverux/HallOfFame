**The screenshot metadata update!**

Restructured upload popup for attaching information about your screenshots:
- Choose whether to share your photo mode settings,
- Choose whether to share your mods playset,
- Select a showcased asset or map, to demo how you used a Paradox Mods asset and make a little publicity for it, as an asset author or satisfied user!
- Four thousand characters of Markdown description! Write the story of your city, explain detailing techniques you’ve used, a poem, anything.

For this update, only the showcased asset/map will be shown in the Hall of Fame’s main menu carousel. \
The description or photo mode settings and playset are not yet shown in the UI, but this will be implemented soon. \
Allowing you to set them right now allows you to start adding more context to your screenshots.

In a second time, a mass editor will also allow you to edit your previous screenshots to add these fields if you wish.
