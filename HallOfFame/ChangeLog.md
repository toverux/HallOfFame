Compatibility for patch 1.2.5f1.

As you have probably noticed, the game now shows a rotating slideshow of 7 images behind the main menu.

- Hall of Fame had to be modified to perform a transparent takeover on the Vanilla system.
- The Vanilla slideshow system is immediately disabled (and not just hidden) to avoid consuming resources.
- The fade-in transition time Hall of Fame uses between image has been reduced from 1.5s to 0.75s to match Vanilla's timing, for a more consistent feeling.
