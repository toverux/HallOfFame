**Changes;**
- Avoid layout shift when displaying the "Translated" hint and make that text a bit smaller.
- Localization updates.

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed the screenshot upload panel misbehaving (not closing or not giving feedback about the upload).
  This caused some players to upload many times the same image. Do not report those images — I will take action to "merge" them.
- Fixed the HoF "take picture" button not having the correct icon.
