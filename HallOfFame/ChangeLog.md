**New features and changes:**

- **New gallery website, made by sparkly_foxxy: https://viewer.halloffame.mtq.io**. Check out your screenshots and other people's work on the web! A button has been added in the mod settings to open your gallery.
- **Add the "Popular" screenshot selection algorithm.** This new algorithm chooses pictures that have a higher-than-median like to view ratio (which is about 9%). This will greatly help good screenshots that don't have an overwhelming number of likes resurface more.

**Improvements:**

- New default screenshot selection algorithms weights are as follows (and as always, are configurable in the mod settings):
  - Popular: 10
  - Trending: 10
  - Recent: 10
  - Forgotten Ones: 0
  - Random: 5
  - Supporter: 1
- Smaller showcased asset/map block that adapts to the size of the content and expands on hover.
- Localization updates.

**Bugfixes:**

- Fixed text overflows in the asset selection dropdown.
