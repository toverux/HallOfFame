**Changes:**
- Commas are now allowed in City Name.
  Do not rename your city if you already removed the comma to be able to upload, or the system will not be able associate old and new screenshots to the same city, a future feature.
- Allow 1-character creator or city name. This is to better support languages like Chinese.

**Bugfixes:**
- It was still possible to interact with the main menu UI even if it was invisible.
- Non-ASCII characters in Creator Name do not result in an error anymore.
- Chinese (simplified and traditional) date localization is fixed.
- Empty creator names will no longer show empty "by " in the main menu.
