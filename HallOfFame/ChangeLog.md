**New features:**
- **LIKES! You can now like images you see in the main menu and boost this content.**
  This is also a “favorites” feature, in the future you will be able to see your liked images in a dedicated UI.
- **New “Trending” algorithm weight in mod options.**
  Trending shows images that have a higher amount of likes per day.
  Now that Trending is a thing, Supporter and Random algorithms have been scaled back to a default weight of 2 (from 5).
- **Back button to see previous images (up to 20).**
- Report image button is now only shown when you hover the city name, freeing up space in the UI.
- Changing your Creator Name in the mod options is now applied immediately.
  If there are problems with your login credentials, this will also be shown in the mod options dynamically.
- Hiding the main menu UI now also hides the game’s FPS overlay.
- Italian and Portuguese localization have been added, updates for other languages.

**Bug fixes:**
- Screenshots with less than 1K population will no longer be rounded down to 0, instead the exact number will be shown.
- XBox Game Pass users won’t need to manually remove their # in front of their username.
