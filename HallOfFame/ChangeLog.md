**New features:**
- Completely revamped menu UI! Sleeeeek.
- Added (configurable) key bindings for Next (right arrow), Previous (left arrow), Like (L) and Toggle Menu UI (space) actions.
- When the main menu loads, a notification will show you how many times your screenshots have been viewed and liked.
  Clicking the notification will show some more global stats in a dialog.

**Changes:**
- Now the view count label is hidden by default, to limit UI clutter. You can opt-in to show it in the settings.
- Default Supporters algorithm weight debuffed to 2 (again).
- Minor improvements/fixes.

*(This is a republish of the very short-lived 1.5.0 version with the load game crash bug fixed, plus the new notification).*
