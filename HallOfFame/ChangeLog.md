**Breaking the language barrier!**

Now Hall of Fame will be able to show a transliterated or translated version of the creator and city names that aren't in Latin script.

This is particularly useful to help remembering who and what you see, and in the future, help searchability.

- A little indicator will show up when a name was automatically translated.
- Names aren't shown translated if they already match the game locale (ex. a Chinese user will still see Chinese but will see translated Russian).
- Three modes are available: disabled, transliteration (which is more accurate) and translation (less accurate but more meaningful).
- Names that contain a mix of latin and other scripts won't be touched as some users like to inline their own translation.
- Tooltips allow you to check out the original name and its transliteration when translations are enabled.
- Mistakes can be signaled to me and fixed manually. Feedback welcome!

**Other changes:**

- Restore pre-1.2.5f1 2D versions of the milestone, population and "pristine wilderness" icons.
- New official logo for Hall of Fame, now used as the icon in the stats notification on startup.
