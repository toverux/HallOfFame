**New features:**
 - You can now download images from the main menu, using the kebab menu (the three dots) and click "Save".
   This will save the 4K version of the image on your computer.

   The location is configurable in the mod settings, but by default they will be saved to `%userprofile%/AppData/LocalLow/Colossal Order/Cities Skylines II/Screenshots/Hall Of Fame Creators`.

   This is great to save the images you'd like to take inspiration from and organize your own collection locally, the way you desire.
