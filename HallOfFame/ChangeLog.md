**Linking social media platforms!**

Next to your username when displaying one of your pictures, Hall of Fame can now
display buttons leading to your other social media accounts.

To link your social media to your HoF creator account, you must contact me (via
any medium, best is Discord, you can also use halloffame at mtq.io) and provide
me with your links.
The following platforms are supported:

- Paradox Mods creator account (opens directly in-game or in the browser)
- YouTube channel
- Twitch channel
- Discord (invite link)
- Reddit user

Of course, your channel/account must contain a fair amount of C:S 2 content to
be relevant.
