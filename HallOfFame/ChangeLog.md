**New features:**

- Hall of Fame will now collect the list of enabled mods and photo mode render settings used when taking a screenshot.
  This will in a future release allow users to check out what mods and photo settings you used for your picture.
- It is now possible to disable Hall of Fame in the main menu, allowing you to only use its screenshotting feature.
- The latest image that was loaded is now also shown in the save loading screen as well.
  There is an opt-out option to disable this behavior.
- Minor UI improvements.
