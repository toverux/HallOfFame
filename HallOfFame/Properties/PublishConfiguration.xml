  <LongDescription># Hall of Fame for Cities: Skylines II

**Share screenshots and admire other creators’ work, all in-game!**

## What does it do?

If you’re in one of those situations, all you need is the mod!

- You hate that you spend so much time on a city, but no one sees it, or at best you post it on
  Reddit, and it still gets forgotten after a few days.
- You want to show off your detailing or city-planning skills.
- You want some inspiration when you fire up the game.
- You’re too lazy to open Reddit and three Discord servers to see some cool cities.
- Oh, and last but not least: the mod allows you to take **4K screenshots**, even when playing at a
  lower resolution, and **makes better screenshot renders than the Vanilla tool**!

This mod allows players to take and upload 4K screenshots of their city and share them with the
community.

Images can then be viewed and liked by other players as a background image in the main menu, and on
the web thanks to our integration with **Cities Collective (https://citiescollective.space)**!

Hall of Fame also makes sure that no city falls into oblivion by displaying each uploaded image as
often as possible!

The likes and trending screenshots mechanisms still allow the best creators to shine, but everyone
is welcome, there is no downvote and no moderation based on skill.

## Rules

### Should I be a pro-detailer to share my screenshots?

**Every** player is welcome to share their creations!
The content is not selected or moderated based on quality or complexity.

Don’t be shy, let us remember your city — if you wanna share it, we wanna see it!

### Linking social media platforms

Next to your username when displaying one of your pictures, Hall of Fame can display buttons leading
to your other social media accounts.

To link your social media accounts by yourself, you need to register/login to Cities Collective
(https://citiescollective.space), then set your social accounts in your dashboard.

Then, link your CC account with Hall of Fame (follow instructions on the site or in the mod’s
settings) — they will now appear automatically on your Hall of Fame pictures!

Alternatively, if you do not want to create a CC account, you can contact me directly to set them up
manually.

### Post-processing and other mods

Yes! — you can use any assets and mods you want. This includes post-processing mods that change
camera settings, add effects, etc., as well as custom content, textures, LUTs, etc.

One of such mods is Lumina, check it out! https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/94394/Windows

The only thing to keep in mind is that the screenshot should still showcase something you can
actually do in the game, including heavily modded, but without external tools.
So, no tampering of the image with other software is allowed; this is not the spirit.

### Inappropriate content

Inappropriate, offensive, provoking, off-topic content will be removed, and your account will be
permanently prohibited from using the service, without warning.

A report button is available in the main menu to report inappropriate content.
It will be immediately unlisted and reviewed by a human.
