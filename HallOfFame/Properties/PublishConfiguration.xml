  <LongDescription># Hall of Fame for Cities: Skylines II

## What does it do?

If you’re in one of those situations, all you need is the mod!
- You hate that you spend so much time on a city, but no one sees it, or at best
  you post it on Reddit, and it still gets forgotten after a few days.
- You want to show off your detailing or city-planning skills.
- You want some inspiration when you fire up the game.
- You’re too lazy to open Reddit and three Discord servers to see some cool
  cities.

This mod allows players to take and upload screenshots of their city, and share
them with the community. Images can then be viewed by other players as a
background image in the main menu, with information about the creator, the city
name, and controls to refresh the image, like/favorite or hide the menu UI to
better see the image, to name a few features.

Hall of Fame then makes sure that no city falls into oblivion, by displaying
each uploaded images as often as possible.

The liking/favorite and trending screenshots mechanisms still allows the best
creators to shine, but everyone is welcome, there is no downvote and no
moderation based on skill.

## Features

- Have pictures displayed in the main menu, with various information about the
  city, the author, etc.
- Choose between Full HD and 4K resolution for pictures shown in the main menu.
- Toggle menu UI visibility to admire the pictures (like a slideshow).
- Fine-tune how the algorithm chooses screenshots that are presented to you
  (recent screenshots, most liked, ancient and forgotten, etc.).
- Make screenshots and upload them via a dedicated interface, all in-game.
- Supersampling all screenshots you make to 4K resolution even if you play at a
  lower resolution.

## Rules

### Should I be a pro detailer to share my screenshots?

**Every** player is welcome to share their creations!
The content is not selected or moderated based on quality or complexity.

Don’t be shy, let us remember your city — if you wanna share it, we wanna see
it!

### Post-processing and other mods

Yes! — you can use any assets and mods you want. This includes post-processing
mods that change camera settings, add effects, etc., as well a custom content,
textures, LUTs, etc.

The only thing to keep in mind is that the screenshot should still showcase
something you can actually do in the game, including heavily modded, but without
external tools.
So, no tampering of the image with other software is allowed, this is not the
spirit.

### Inappropriate content

Inappropriate, offensive, provoking, off-topic content will be removed and your
account will be permanently prohibited from using the service, without warning.

A report button is available in the main menu to report inappropriate content.
It will be immediately unlisted and reviewed by a human.

## Participate in the project

### Get support, report bugs, discuss

You can join the Cities: Skylines Modding Discord server and join us in the
dedicated thread **pdxm-mods-published › Hall of Fame**.

Bug reports with useful reproduction steps and/or logs are also very welcome on
GitHub!

### Feedback and Feature requests

We have a feedback and feature requests board here where you can suggest and
vote on features you’d like to see in the mod:
https://feedback.halloffame.cs2.mtq.io

It takes a minute to sign up, but your feedback would be very appreciated!

### Translations

The mod is natively available in English and French. Other languages will be
supported soon via Crowdin.

### Donating

Hall of Fame has low, but nonetheless existing, running costs: hosting the
server and your images is not free.

Donations are very welcome and will help keep the service running.

I will soon publish, here or directly in the mod the exact donation/expenditure
balance so people are encouraged to donate when the balance is in the red.
(Or just donate because you like the mod!)

## Known issues

### Supersampling artifacts

All screenshots are taken at a minimum of 4K resolution, even if you are using
a lower resolution in-game, so that users using a better resolution can enjoy
your images in the best quality.

**On some systems, this can cause supersampling artifacts, where the image
becomes very grainy or things that aren’t normally there appear in the
screenshot.**

Those rendering issues are not caused by the mod itself, but by the game engine,
to simplify, it just makes problems normally not visible at your resolution
visible in 4K, or “enlarges” them.

So, take a close look at your screenshots before uploading them, seek for
abnormalities, and if you see some that bother you, you could try the following:
- Take the screenshot again from a slightly different position.
- Disable DLSS or FSR if you have it enabled.
- Scale back a little on some photo mode settings that can cause rendering
  issues (typical with clouds, for example).

If the problem is too common/prominent on your machine, please ping me or upvote
this post https://feedback.halloffame.cs2.mtq.io/posts/22 so that I’m aware of
the prevalence of this issue and make supersampling opt-out.

### Possible (benign) crash at game load

There is a bug in cohtml engine (the UI layer of Cities: Skylines II) that can
cause random (generally rare) crashes **for some users** with some playsets.

This happens only at game load and does not f* up your savegame or settings,
it’s just a bit annoying.

The symptom is a crash to desktop with no error message in Player.log, a split
second after the main menu appears.

We’re still trying to figure out what triggers it and how to work around that
problem, but in the meantime, if you experience this issue, you can either
disable the mod or just accept it (or help me debug this thing lol) :D
